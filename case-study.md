# Case Study

Here's a brief summary of the key points:

1. AML is a national network of library branches across England.
2. It offers various media services including books, journals, CDs, DVDs, games, and multimedia titles.
3. The system needs to support in-branch, online (web and mobile), and telephone services.
4. It must be available 24/7 for online services and adhere to WCAG 2 accessibility standards.
5. The system should be scalable to handle 20% of England's population (about 11.2 million users) with 10% annual growth.
6. It needs to enable resource sharing among branches within the same city.
7. Key objectives include enhancing member experience, enabling multi-channel access, implementing scalable online systems, efficient resource management, user-friendly interfaces, flexible payment options, streamlined procurement, and data-driven decision making.
