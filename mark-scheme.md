# Mark Scheme

To achieve a First in this assessment, you should aim to meet the following criteria for each task:

### Task 1 (60% of total grade):

1. Architecture (40% of Task 1):
   * Present high-quality use cases with clear steps and alternate scenarios
   * Create a comprehensive context model including all users and their interactions
   * Develop a container model reflecting all functional and non-functional requirements
   * Document well-supported architectural decisions with references
   * Ensure all models are consistent and effectively presented
   * Consider going beyond taught approaches to enhance model quality
2. Design (40% of Task 1):
   * Produce high-quality C4 Level 3 (Component) and Level 4 (Code) models
   * Include comprehensive data design and user interaction design
   * Effectively utilize appropriate design patterns
   * Ensure all diagrams are consistent and align with chosen patterns
   * Address all functional and non-functional requirements
   * Present well-organized, clear, and concise documentation with effective diagrams
3. Individual Reflective Account (20% of Task 1):
   * Clearly define success criteria
   * Provide a thorough evaluation of the architecture and design against these criteria
   * Include a detailed presentation of lessons learned
   * Consider discussing alternative approaches that could have been taken

### Task 2 (40% of total grade):

1. Video Presentation (20% of Task 2):
   * Demonstrate software that meets all requirements
   * Present a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of software architecture and design concepts
   * Justify the selection of appropriate tools, frameworks, and techniques
   * Organize the presentation clearly and concisely with effective visual aids
2. Individual STAR Analysis Report (40% of Task 2):
   * Provide a comprehensive identification of potential issues and their impacts on project success
   * Define roles clearly with a strong grasp of responsibilities
   * Execute a substantial number of tasks with thoughtful reflection on results and improvements
   * Present evidence of participation in two sprints
   * Ensure the report is well-organized, clear, and concise
3. Individual Design Validation (40% of Task 2):
   * Conduct thorough validation with extensive testing and proof of concept
   * Demonstrate design effectiveness, addressing all key requirements
   * Validate at least two non-functional requirements (e.g., performance and security)
   * Reflect on results and discuss possible changes due to validation
   * Present a user evaluation plan with justification, recruitment strategy, and ethical considerations
   * Aim for production-level quality software
   * Organize the report exceptionally well, ensuring clarity and conciseness

To achieve an exceptional First, go beyond these criteria by demonstrating profound knowledge and understanding of the subject, conducting thorough critical analysis, and including extensive research beyond the required scope.
