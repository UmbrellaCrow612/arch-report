# Summarises assessment brief

## Task 1:

* Develop a solution architecture and design for the provided case study.
* Create the following artifacts: a) A group report (\~2400 words) including:
  * Use case diagram
  * 6 detailed use case descriptions (2 per team member)
  * User Interface design (wireframes)
  * Architecture description using C4 model (context, container, component, and code diagrams)
  * Data design (domain model)
  * Architecture decision records
  * Security elements (authentication, access control) b) Individual reflection (\~600 words) on the architecture and design

## Task 2:

* Validate your architecture by building a proof of concept
* You can use any programming language for this

3. Follow the project roadmap provided in the document.
4. Submit all artifacts to the module Blackboard site by the deadline.
5. Use appropriate tools for modelling (e.g., StarUML, Visual Paradigm, draw.io).
6. Consider different types of users, inclusive design, and assistive technologies in your approach.
7. Address the challenges related to design, usability, security, and privacy presented in the case study.
8. Be prepared for regular formative feedback at key milestones.

Remember to review the SHU Development Process, particularly techniques expected at level 6, and consult with your tutor if you need to make changes to the requirements.
