# Assessment brief

1. Form a team of 3 members within the first two weeks.
2. Complete two main tasks:

### Task 1:

* Develop a solution architecture and design for the given case study
* Produce a descriptive report (Software Design Description) as a group (\~2400 words)
* Write an individual reflection on the architecture and design (\~600 words)

#### The group report should include:

* Use case diagram
* Detailed use case descriptions (2 per student)
* User Interface design (wireframes)
* Architecture description using C4 model (context, container, component, and code diagrams)
* Data design
* Architecture decision records
* Security elements

### Task 2:

* Build a proof of concept (PoC) to validate your design
* Create a video presentation (max 5 minutes per student)
* Write a STAR analysis report of your role in the project (800 words)
* Produce an individual design validation report (800 words)

3. Follow the provided roadmap/milestones, which outlines weekly progress from project initiation to final submission.
4. Seek formative feedback during lab sessions and drop-in sessions.
5. Submit your work for both tasks separately on Blackboard by the deadline (19th December 3 PM).
6. Ensure all documents are submitted in both .docx and .pdf formats within zip files.
7. Adhere to the writing style guidelines, including using passive voice and APA referencing.
8. Stay within the specified word limits for each component.

Remember to carefully select a subset of the most relevant requirements for your PoC implementation, as you're not expected to implement every requirement from the case study.
